# MB-901: Dynamics 365 Fundamentals 
## Module 12, Lab 1 - Explore security roles in Dynamics 365 model-driven applications

**Scenario:** As a system administrator, you need to find out what are the available out of the box security roles of Dynamics 365.

**Note:**  Given that this lab requires admin access to the environment, this lab will need to be demonstrated by the instructor.

## Instructions

1. In order to navigate to Dynamics 365 Settings dashboard, add **?settingsonly=true** at the end of the URL link of your Dynamics 365 business applications. Your URL should look like the following: **https://crmYOURID.crm.dynamics.com/main.aspx?settingsonly=true**. (This example resembles a sample only and does not work if you navigate to it.)
2. The **System** settings dashboard appears.
3. Use the **Dynamics 365** > **Settings** menu from the action pane to see the menu items. From the **System** group area, select **Security**
4. The **Security** dashboard appears. From the dashboard select **Security roles**. 
5. Here, you can see all of out of the box security roles in Dynamics 365.
6. Select the **Sales Manager** role. Select **Core Records** tab. By using the **Security role** form, you can change security settings for this role in different functional areas.
